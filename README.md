# QRCodeForPlacementProcess
This is an iOS application which helps both aspirant as well as interviewer for the placement process.
We all know that the recruitment process does the very important role in everyone's life. So, this application will help both aspirants and the company as well.
So, let me tell you what this application does! First of all, let's start with the aspirant side. He/She can apply to this recruitment process off campus without even visiting the company. Simply what he needs to do is download this application in his iPhone, register into it by filling the required details and then he can simply check the vacancy or openings of the company and if he is interested he can apply from this application itself.
After viewing his resume if the company finds it appropriate, then they will be sending him the QR code in the email address provided, he can simply scan it from home in this application itself and can give the test. So the advantage here is if he is currently working in a company then no need to take a day off for this aptitude test. He can give it anytime in the given time period by the company.
So, this saves the paper and this is one step

towards eco-friendly India.
Then the company will view his marks and if he is eligible for an interview then they will send an email for the schedule of interview else the email that he is not eligible.
And the actual idea was, sometimes the situation takes place such that 3 interviewers were going to take the interview, but at the time of interview one of them is absent, then in this situation interview gets rescheduled and this may be inconvenient to the aspirant. So, the interviewer will record the interview and send it to that absent interviewer. And then they will discuss among themselves and give the results. But for recording this interview, freeware is not available, we need a developer's account, but yes we can definitely extend this.
Now, for the admin side, when they take an aptitude test they will have to keep 4 5 sets of aptitude then they will require to maintain the forms that were filled by aspirants and also keep their resumes, and hence this will increase a bunch of paper which is difficult to maintain and requires more people to maintain

them and also after completing the test the papers are checked by a human, mistakes may take place, time-consuming, many people required.
And using this application work will be easy, the admin can maintain all data easily in tabular format and will generate QR code for the test and send it to aspirants by email. Then, the application will check the tests and marks will be displayed in sorted form according to the technology and vacancy. Now, after viewing the marks they can schedule the interview easily from the application.
